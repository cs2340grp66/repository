    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    59:F8:4C:36:D4:C8:06:0F:B5:61:5B:1F:56:06:A8:22:05:2B:06:77

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
